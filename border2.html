            <h1 style="color: blue;"> Who discovered Mercury?</h1>
            <h6 style="color: brown;">Mercury is one of the five classical planets visible with the naked eye and is
                named after the swift-footed
                Roman messenger god. It is not known exactly when the planet was first discovered - although it was
                first
                observed through telescopes in the seventeenth century by astronomers Galileo Galilei and Thomas
                Harriot.

                Only two spacecraft, both robotic and launched by NASA, have visited Mercury so far, making it the least
                explored terrestrial planet. Mariner 10 launched in 1973 and imaged around 45% of the planet's surface
                from
                1974 until its end of mission in March 1975.

                MESSENGER was launched in 2004 and entered Mercury's orbit in 2011, making it the first spacecraft to do
                so.
                This mission lasted for four years before the probe succumbed to the planet's gravity and impacted its
                surface in 2015. It collected extensive data and images and transmitted them back to Earth to be studied
                by
                scientists.</h6><br><br>

            <h1 style="color: chartreuse;">Why is Venus called Earth's sister?</h1>
            <h6 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 242);"> Venus has been called Earth’s twin or sister because of the
                similarities in their masses, sizes, and
                densities and their similar relative locations in the solar system. Because they presumably formed in
                the
                solar nebula from the same kind of rocky planetary building blocks, they also likely have similar
                overall
                chemical compositions. However, Venus and Earth have evolved surface conditions that could hardly be
                more
                different. Venus is extremely hot, dry, and in other ways so forbidding that it is improbable that life
                as
                it is understood on Earth could have developed there.</h6><br><br>

            <h1 style="color: crimson;">can it ran as Fish ?</h1>
            <h6 style=color:darkorange> Although rare, there are numerous instances of fish falling down from the skies.
                Of course, the fish do
                not really "rain" in the sense of condensing out of water vapor. The fish that fall from the sky are
                just
                fish that used to be in the sea. So what puts the fish up in the sky in the first place? Although few
                detailed scientific observations have been performed on this phenomenon, the common consensus is that
                tornadoes are the culprit. When tornadoes traverse over bodies of water, they become known as
                waterspouts.
                Waterspouts suck up lake or ocean water along with the fish or other creatures swimming in the water.
                The
                fish are sucked up the tornado's vortex and then blown around in the clouds until the windspeed
                decreases
                enough to let them fall back to the ground, perhaps miles away from where they started. According to
                Bill
                Evans' meteorology book titled It's Raining Fish and Spiders, creatures fall from the sky about forty
                times
                a year. All sorts of creatures have been reported raining down, including snakes, worms, and crabs, but
                fish
                and frogs are the most common. Even squid and alligators have been reported to fall from the sky. Often,
                the
                process of being swept high into the clouds encases these creatures in a layer of ice or hail that may
                still
                remain after they have plummeted back to earth. Raining creatures encased in blocks of ice can be very
                dangerous and have been known to smash through car windshields. If you see any wildlife falling from the
                sky, seek shelter indoors immediately.</h6>

            <h1 style="color: darkred;">Does life exist on Mars now? </h1>
            <h6 style="color: darkturquoise;">There is a slim chance that microbial life exists on Mars today, perhaps
                under the planet’s ice caps or in
                subsurface lakes detected by spacecraft like the European Space Agency’s Mars Express. Locations like
                these
                could protect life from the harsh conditions on the planet's surface.

                Because the kind of life that we think could exist on Mars today is microbial, it wouldn’t be spotted by
                the
                cameras of an orbiting spacecraft. Instead, there are ways we could detect it indirectly through
                chemical
                signatures linked to life called biosignatures.

                One such biosignature is methane, which can be created by both biological and geological processes.
                Curiosity has detected methane near its landing site in Gale Crater, but this isn't conclusive; the
                European
                Space Agency’s Trace Gas Express Orbiter has not found signs of the chemical in Mars’ atmosphere.</h6>

            <h1 style="color: hotpink;">Jupiter a gas planet?</h1>
            <h6 style="color: mediumblue;"> Yes, but don't be fooled into thinking that Jupiter is like a big cloud of
                gas that you could fly through,
                it's more like a fluid planet that gets denser and hotter the deeper you go.

                Pressures at the colorful cloud tops are not dissimilar to those in Earth's atmosphere, but they build
                up as
                you go deeper, rather like a submarine experiencing crushing densities as it sinks deeper and deeper
                into
                our oceans. In fact, the hydrogen that is Jupiter's dominant gas gets compressed to such extremes that
                it
                changes to an exotic metallic hydrogen form. So think of Jupiter as a bottomless ocean of strange,
                exotic
                materials.</h6>

            <h1 style="color: orangered;">was Saturn discovered?</h1>
            <h6 style="color: springgreen;">Saturn was first discovered back in 1610 by Galileo Galilei. As one of the
                first people to use a telescope,
                Galileo made several discoveries of planets and moons in our solar system. saturn is the most impotant planent in the whole universe</h6>

            <h1 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 242);"> Why are Uranus and Neptune sometimes referred to as "twins"?</h1>
            <h6 style="color:blueviolet;">ice giants are very similar in mass and sizes and also happen to be the furthest
                planets out in the solar system. They have other similarities like average density, but they definitely
                can't be called "identical twins."

                They are different in the amount of heat they radiate, their axial tilt, and their satellite systems;
                Uranus has small regular moons and overall has 27 known moons, while Neptune's moon Triton is much
                larger and is probably a captured moon.

                What we want to know is whether these unique differences are because of different formation processes,
                or if Uranus and Neptune were relatively similar after formation until other processes occurred that led
                to these differences. For example, did a gigantic impact at some point in the past cause some of these
                differences.

                Understanding the origin of these differences between Uranus and Neptune is also critical to better
                characterize this planetary type. </h6>

            <h6 style="color: darkblue;">Launched in 1977 to explore the outer solar system, NASA's Voyager 2 was the only spacecraft to fly by
            Neptune. It observed Neptune from a distance of about 4400 km in 1989 after having studied Uranus. The probe
            gathered information on Neptune's magnetic field, atmosphere, and several of the planet's moons. Voyager 2
            also discovered Neptune's Great Dark Spot.</h6>
